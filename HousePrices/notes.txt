Statistical measures

Skewness(Fisher-Person): 
a measure of symmetry, the skewness for a normal distribution is zero.
The more close to zero, the more symmetric the data is. 
If <0, then the data is skewed left. Otherwise skewed right.

Kurtosis:
a measure of tails(outliers).
The kurtosis for a standard normal distribution is 3.
When Fisher's definition is used, then the kurtosis for N(0,1) is 0.
When positive, the data is heavy-tailed: lots of outliers.
When negative, the data is light-tailed: lack of outliers.
